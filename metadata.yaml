description: '"... the story of a bank worker and his interfering sister, Felicia,
  who visits him in New York each winter. It also portrays the nuptials of their nephew
  and niece, Ruth and Jack. The work examines the increasing materialism and changing
  attitudes of people at the turn of the 20th century and suggests that the affection
  and support of family elders plays a pivotal role in young peoples'' lives."--Goodreads.'
